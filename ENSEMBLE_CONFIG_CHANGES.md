# Ensemble Configuration Architecture Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed scikit-learn Dependency
- Installed `scikit-learn` and `numpy` for diversity calculations
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with the new dependencies

### 2. Refactored Model Configurations

The `model_configs.py` file now properly references existing system prompts instead of duplicating them:

- **GPT-OSS 20B**: Uses "Absolute" system prompt + Compliance Protocol + High reasoning
- **Gemma3 12B**: Uses "M2M" prompt for structured thinking
- **Mistral 24B**: Uses "Shadow" prompt with adversarial enhancements
- **Qwen3 30B**: Uses "Assistant" prompt with comprehensive analysis focus
- **DeepSeek-R1 32B**: Uses "Assistant" prompt with deep analysis specialization

### 3. Model-Specific Settings

The ensemble orchestrator now properly handles model-specific settings:

```python
# GPT-OSS gets special treatment
if model_config.name == "gpt-oss:20b":
    model_specific_settings["compliance_protocol"] = True
    model_specific_settings["reasoning_effort"] = "high"
```

### 4. Architecture Benefits

- **No Duplication**: System prompts are referenced, not copied
- **Maintainability**: Changes to system prompts automatically apply to ensemble
- **Flexibility**: Each model can have its own specific settings
- **Consistency**: All models use the same base prompt system

### 5. Model Roles and Specializations

Each model has specific roles optimized for ensemble diversity:

| Model | Primary Role | System Prompt | Special Features |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| GPT-OSS 20B | Reasoning/Factual | Absolute | Compliance + High reasoning |
| Gemma3 12B | Creative/Synthesis | M2M | Structured output capability |
| Qwen3 30B | Comprehensive | Assistant | Extended context (256K) |
| DeepSeek-R1 32B | Deep Analysis | Assistant | Advanced reasoning |
| Mistral 24B | Adversarial/Critical | Shadow | Uncensored perspective |

### 6. Configuration Validation

All configurations have been tested and verified:
- System prompt lookups work correctly
- Model-specific enhancements are properly applied
- Temperature ranges are correctly distributed
- All 5 models are included in the default ensemble

## Usage

The ensemble system is now fully integrated and can be accessed via:
1. Right-click the send button
2. Select "Ensemble Response (5 Models)"
3. The system will automatically configure each model with its optimal settings

## Technical Details

- Base prompts are loaded from `system_prompts.py`
- Model-specific enhancements are appended to base prompts
- Confidence instructions are added to all models
- Adversarial prompts rotate through different challenge types
- Performance tracking persists across sessions

This architecture ensures the ensemble system remains maintainable and consistent with the rest of the application while providing maximum flexibility for model-specific optimizations.
